        <p><b>Futbol Club Barcelona</b> (Catalan pronunciation: [fubˈbɔl ˈklub bəɾsəˈlonə] ⓘ), commonly known as
            Barcelona
            and familiarly as Barça ([ˈbaɾsə]), is a professional football club based in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain,
            that
            competes in La Liga, the top flight of Spanish football.</p>

        <p>Founded in 1899 by a group of Swiss, Catalan, German, and English footballers led by Joan Gamper, the club
            has
            become a symbol of Catalan culture and Catalanism, hence the motto "Més que un club" ("More than a
            club").[2]
            Unlike many other football clubs, the supporters own and operate Barcelona. It is the third-most valuable
            football club in the world, worth $5.51 billion, and the world's fourth richest football club in terms of
            revenue, with an annual turnover of €800.1 million.[3][4] The official Barcelona anthem is the "Cant del
            Barça",
            written by Jaume Picas and Josep Maria Espinàs.[5] Barcelona traditionally play in dark shades of blue and
            garnet stripes, hence nicknamed Blaugrana.</p>

        <p>Domestically, Barcelona has won a record 77 trophies: 27 La Liga, 31 Copa del Rey, 14 Supercopa de España,
            three
            Copa Eva Duarte, and two Copa de la Liga titles, as well as being the record holder for the latter four
            competitions. In international club football, the club has won 22 European and worldwide titles: five UEFA
            Champions League titles, a record four UEFA Cup Winners' Cups, five UEFA Super Cups, a record three
            Inter-Cities
            Fairs Cups, a joint record two Latin Cups, and three FIFA Club World Cups.[6][7][8] Barcelona was ranked
            first
            in the International Federation of Football History & Statistics Club World Ranking for 1997, 2009, 2011,
            2012,
            and 2015, and occupies the ninth position on the UEFA club rankings as of May 2023.[9][10][11] The club has
            a
            long-standing rivalry with Real Madrid, and matches between the two teams are referred to as El Clásico.
